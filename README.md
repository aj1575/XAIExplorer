🌐 XAI Explorer

An interactive Streamlit dashboard for interpreting machine learning models using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).
This tool empowers users to visualize both global and local feature importance, making ML models more transparent and trustworthy.

⸻

🔍 Features
	•	📁 Upload any CSV dataset for instant analysis
	•	🧠 Automatically identifies classification or regression tasks
	•	🌲 Trains a Random Forest model on-the-fly
	•	🧮 Generates global feature importance with SHAP beeswarm plots
	•	🔬 Provides local explanations via SHAP waterfall plots
	•	💾 Export visualizations for reports and presentations
	•	🧠 Handles both numerical and categorical features seamlessly
